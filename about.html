    <div class="GPA">
        <p>I grew up in the Sierra Nevada’s and was exposed to lumber and wood from an early age. My father dabbled in wood working and I grew up watching him build things -- from the house we lived in, to the furniture and household items we used in our home. 
            I have always had a love for trees and wood but pursued a career in other endeavors. I worked thirty years in health care administrating dialysis clinics, with a little dabbling here and there teaching college courses in psychology. As I neared retirement, I wanted to do activities that would keep me busy in my retirement years and I fell into the things I grew up with. I still had some of my dad’s tools and it became a natural fit to start working with wood again. I began making things for friends and family that led to requests for tables, clocks, monogramed signs and Lazy Susan’s. Thus, the journey began.
            I have twelve grandchildren and they all call me GPa. I wanted to spend my free time in retirement working in wood, but also maybe to pass on a legacy to my grandchildren. Hopefully one of them will enjoy creating works of art in wood. Therefore, the creation of GPa’s Workshop.
